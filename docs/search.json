    "text": "Droughts have always played a crucial role in determining the structure and composition of vegetation across the Australian continent, either directly by causing mortality or dieback in water-stressed plants, or in conjunction with other drivers such as grazing, fire, or invasive species. Arid zone ecosystems are no exception: major episodes of drought-induced dieback of trees, shrubs and grasses have been seen across Central Australia from the earliest days of European settlement, with particularly notable events occurring during the 1895-1903 Federation Drought and the exceptionally dry periods of the 1920s-1930s and 1950s-60s.

At Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, Northern Territory, virtually no rain fell in 2018, and by 2019 vegetation across the Park was showing signs of severe stress. By 2020 mortality of trees, shrubs and grasses had become widespread, affecting dominant species like desert oak (Allocasuarina decaisneana), mulga (Acacia aneura) and spinifex (Triodia spp.).\n\n\n\nDrought affected desert oak south-east of Uluru. This photo was taken in 2025, when some trees had partially recovered following rain.\n\n\nThis is where my research partner, Nunzio Knerr, and I entered the story. While working of tree death in northern NSW in 2021, we heard from a colleague at Parks Australia, who manage Uluru Kata-Tjuta NP, about the scale of dieback that had occurred there, and developed a project there to document the spatial extent of vegetation mortality and to identify areas that were very sensitive to drought or which acted as refugial habitats for drought-sensitive species. The immediate problem was the sheer size of the study area - a massive 2,000 km2 - and the diversity of species, soil types and landforms that occurred there. To map such a large and varied landscape using spatial mapping techniques would require a very large number of plots, far more than we could could possibly collect in a week of field work time using traditional ecological survey techniques.\n\n\n\nDesert oak - spinifex communities at Uluru-Kata Tjuta NP, Northern Territory.\n\n\nSo, we decided to get creative.

So, we purchased two of the cameras, laid out an ambitious set of 30 transects - each 1 km to 4 km long - across the Park, and recorded video along each, all in just 3 days!\nThe next challenge was to figure out how to collect data on vegetation health across the Park, and to do this we (Nunzio led the coding) created a software package called Panospheric image annotator in R - ‘pannotator’ - which allowed us to visualise each image in panoramic mode, map them on satellite imagery, and annotate each with drop down menus containing categories for vegetation cover, size class, and health - all in a single GUI.

    "title": "The Australian ‘dust bowl’",
    "section": "",
    "text": "One of the more interesting pieces of research that I did while writing my book “Drought Country” was to investigate the distribution and severity of wind erosion that occurred in southern, eastern and central Australia during the long ‘megadrought’ of ca. 1895-1946. This was a chronically dry period, roughly bounded by the Federation Drought (1895-1903) and the WWII Drought (1937-46), which featured incredible dust storms, soil loss, sand drift, and permanent or semi-permanent damage to rangeland and farming country.\nWhile the impacts of these extreme events can still be seen in degraded mediterranean and semi-arid landscapes of South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales today, I have always found it fascinating that this era has been largely forgotten and has only recently entered academic discourse. Indeed, most people are unaware that, like the Great Plains of the United States, Australia experienced its own ‘dust bowl’ that was longer, covered a similar area, and featured many of the same drivers of environmental degradation.\nWe are not retrofitting modern concepts of the US Dust Bowl into Australia history, either. Many newspaper articles from that time described inland southern and eastern Australia as a ‘dust bowl’, and there was a very real concern that wind erosion and the relentless march of dunes of sand and soil would eventually engulf the wetter agricultural districts of eastern temperate NSW and Victoria. Stories from the entire ‘dust bowl’ era, which describe train tracks and roads being covered in drifting sand, trees having roots exposed and bark stripped off by wind scouring, and dust storms so thick that people needed lanterns in them middle of the day to move around, make interesting reading!"

    "text": "Mapping the ‘dust bowl’\nPrevious authors (e.g., Cattle SR (2016) Aeolian Research 21: 1-20 ; Bailey JS & Bailey JS (2016) Dust Bowl: Depression America to World War Two Australia, pp. 155-201) have discussed the Australian ‘dust bowl’, but here I was interested in mapping the distribution of the landscapes affected and then to link these to agriculture and other land management failures at the time. I did this by reading newspapers from the entire period of 1895-1946 and locating records of severe aeolian sand drift and soil movement. The results are shown in the following figure, which indicates that severe sand and soil erosion began during the severe rabbit plagues of the early 1890s just prior to the Federation Drought, with the worst-affected areas being in the sandy mallee country of south-eastern South Australia, although Victoria and the NSW Riverina were also affected.\nLater, and particularly during the 1912-1915 WWI Drought, severe wind erosion and drift developed in the mallee region of northern Victoria, and then in central Australia during the 1920s-1930s. Severe ‘dust bowl’ conditions re-emerged in Victoria and eastern NSW during the WWII drought, before receding, first in SA and Victoria in 1946, and then further north and inland during the wetter years of the late 1940s. In total, perhaps 800,000 km2 of southern, central and south-easten Australia suffered major wind erosion, inclduing around 200,000 km2 of the southern mallee country.\n\n\n\nDistribution and images of the Australian ‘dust bowl’"

    "section": "Causes and solutions",
    "text": "Causes and solutions\nThe Australian ‘dust bowl’ had multiple causes. Much of the mallee country of SA and Victoria is dominated by sandy soils, and large areas contain vegetated sand dunes that were last highly active during the most recent Pleistocene glacial period. The great rabbit plagues of the 1880s-1890s stripped vegetation from these areas, as did overstocking by sheep, but it was the clearing of mallee eucalypts, burning of regrowth, and then ploughing on sand dunes in cropping country that led to the first really large-scale aeolian (wind-driven) mobilisation of sand and soil, especially with the onset of the horrendous Federation Drought. Overstocking and the trampling of sandy country and clay-loam soils across the Riverina and Darling regions of NSW also caused wind erosion and tremendous dust storms which afflicted much of eastern Australia during dry or drought years.\nThe decline of the ‘dust bowl’ was a matter of land management reforms and a series of fortunate events. The most important factor, in my view, was the sustained increase in rainfall that began in SA and Victoria in 1946, and then across central Australia and western NSW and Queensland in 1947. Severe droughts became (for a while!) a thing of the past, and in many areas there was simply little or no lighter topsoil left to blow away even when drought did return. Vegetation began to recover on drought-affected country, and the spread of myxomatosis in the 1940s also drastically reduced rabbit numbers and hence excess grazing pressure. But we must also recognise that scientific and policy approaches to combat soil erosion gathered pace through the 1930s and 1940s, largely in response to the terrible degradation experienced through the ‘dust bowl’ period, and these began to truly transform the management of cropping and pastoral country across inland Australia in the 1950s and 1960s."

However, the extreme dry conditions experienced during the 2001-2009 Millennium Drought ushered in the return of wind erosion and moblisation of soil and sand across much of the southern and eastern inland, albeit on a scale less severe than during the ‘dust bowl’. Nevertheless, the fact that major dust storms repeatedly swept across the east of the continent and even into major cities showed that without careful management of agricultural cropping and grazing systems, conditions like those experienced during the ‘dust bowl’ could indeed return.\n\n\n\nDust storm near Dubbo, central NSW, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nSand deposited in stock yards in western NSW, 2018"

    "section": "",
    "text": "The great modernist architect Louis Kahn once said “You say to a brick, ‘What do you want, brick?’ And brick says to you, ‘I like an arch.’”  What he saw was that even inanimate objects want to be a part of something greater than itself. At the risk of getting too philosophical, I think ice is the same – it wants to be a glacier. I’ve always loved valley glaciers: their ambition is to slip their confines and spread out into a classic piedmont terminus – finally realising their most beautiful shape. I have even made a ‘glacier’ out of bricks at my home in Canberra!\n\nBut sadly, while travelling across Alaska and western Canada last year, I was shocked to see how much glaciers that once spread onto valley floors have retreated. Here are a few examples.\n\nExit Glacier\nThe Exit Glacier lies approximately 13 km northwest of Seward, Alaska. Arising in the massive Harding Icefield in the Kenai Mountains, the Exit Glacier is a pronounced tongue of ice that flows about 5 km eastward towards the valley of the Resurrection River. From the Exit Glacier trailhead you have a beautiful walk of around 1.5 km to an overlook from which you can see the glacier in the valley below.\n\n\n\nExit Glacier overlook, 2024. The glacier no longer fills the valley below, but can still be seen in the right background.\n\n\nWhile the decline of the glacier between 2010 and 2024 has certainly been significant, the following map reveals that the process has been ongoing since the end of the Little Ice Age in the early 1800s. At its maximum, the glacier would have been a mile-wide wall of ice stretching nearly all the way across the valley, but since then, the terminus has retreated by almost 3 km. It is now a narrow tongue of ice sitting in the bottom of a steep valley, barely visible from the Exit Glacier Viewpoint.\n\n\n\nSatellite image courtesy Google Earth\n\n\n\n\nAthabasca Glacier\nThe Athabasca Glacier is visible from the Icefields Parkway in Alberta, Canada, about half way between Lake Louise and Jasper. The Parkway is easily one of the most beautiful drives I have ever been on, and the winter scenery was spectacular! It is still incredibly impressive, but now you must walk more than 1.5 km from the lower carpark to get to the ice, significantly further than in 1989, when I first visited it.\n\nIt is still incredibly impressive, but now you must walk more than 1.5 km from the lower carpark to get to the ice, significantly further than in 1989, when I first visited it. You can see how the ice has retreated in the image below.\n\n\n\nImages courtesy Google Earth\n\n\nAgain, however, the Athabasca Glacier was much bigger in the past. As you can see in the image below it extended to the edge of the Icefields Parkway in the early 1900s. Furthermore, this comparison highlights the fact that although it is easy to focus on the retreat of the terminus over time, the decline in ice volume due to thinning is a far better metric of glacial retreat under climate warming.\n\n\n\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International; originally published in Sanseverino M & Whitney M (2016) Mountain Research and Development 36: DO - 10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-16-0MatM0038.1\n\n\n\n\nMatanuska Glacier\nFinally, let’s have a look at the Matanuska Glacier a spectacular river of ice that flows out of the northern Chugach Mountains, east of Anchorage, Alaska. I have seen many glaciers in New Zealand, the western USA and southern British Columbia, but at more than 2.5 km across and 40 km long, this glacier is on a different level. In one of my LinkedIn posts I have written about the retreat of the Matanuska Glacier by more than 100 km that has occurred since the end of the Last Glacial Maximum around 18,000 years ago, and particularly about the relatively small change in temperature (2-3 degrees C) involved.\n\n\n\nThe Matanuska Glacier during the last glacial and today.\n\n\nHere the news is somewhat better: although there has been some retreat over the past few decades, the losses have been small compared to the Exit and Athabasca Glaciers, and the Matanuska remains an impressive sight from the Glenn Highway.\n\n\n\nMatanuska Glacier, May 2024\n\n\n\n\nReflection\nToday, we are being inundated with a seemingly endless stream of ‘bad news’ stories about climate change, from coral reefs to arctic permafrost, from Australian eucalypt forests to North American deserts. All deserve our attention. But for me the loss of glaciers is perhaps the most painful of all. Glaciers are perhaps the largest things in terrestrial landscapes that are in constant motion - almost like living things - and it seems impossible that something so monumental can eventually disappear … worn down by processes that are scarcely visible in hours or days, but overwhelming when measured in decades. In this way, perhaps, their decline mirrors the totality of human impact on the earth, a process that leaves us all ultimately impoverished."

    "text": "My colleague Nunzio Knerr and I have just been lucky enough to have our paper ‘Rapid ecological data collection from 360-degree imagery using visualisation and immersive sampling in the R pannotator package’ published in the March edition of the journal Methods and Ecology and Evolution (vol. 16, pp. 640-654; https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.14472). And our image was selected to be on the cover! This is a first for both of us, and it is very exciting to see our work featured prominently in such a great journal.\n\n\n\nThe cover image was taken with a GoPro Max 360-degree camera near Uluru (Ayers Rock) in central Australia in 2022, and shows the ‘tiny earth’ that results when you map the entire panospheric image onto a flat plane. The image was taken in spinifex (Triodia spp.) grassland and you can see blacked areas killed by drought in 2018-2020; also visible is dead mulga (Acacia aneura) to the left and Uluru at the top right.\nThe image was taken as part of a large collaborative study between CSIRO, Parks Australia and local Anangu people undertaken to investigate the impact of the severe 2017-2020 drought on native vegetation across Ulruru-Kata Tjuta National Park. When visiting the region in 2022 it became clear that dieback of trees, shrubs and spinifex grasses had occurred on such a massive spatial scale, and across so many species, that we were simply incapable of capturing sufficient data to map affected areas using traditional ecological field survey techniques.\nTo solve this problem we devised a technique for rapidly surveying vegetation and landscapes using 360-degree cameras, and then developed a new R software package (panoramic image annotator in R - pannotator) that allowed us to visualise panospheric images in panoramic mode, map the location of each image, and annotate the images with ecological data using customisable drop-down menus. The resulting data can be exported and then used for a wide variety of spatial mapping and data analytical purposes.\n\n\n\nThe use of 360-degree cameras and the pannotator package have revolutionized our ecological research by making it easy to collect the very large amounts of data necessary to map vegetation and landscape features across very large spatial scales. Indeed, in just 3 days we were able to enough images to map dieback for multiple species at 10 m x 10 m resolution across a 2,000 km2 study area centred on Ulruru-Kata Tjuta National Park. Our paper dives into the technical details of how we leveraged this technology to achieve this goal, and offers a new perspective on ecological sampling that we hope will inspire further research in the field.\nIn coming months I will be developing a series of posts and tutorials using this approach, so stay tuned!"
